# Hi, I'm Hamed Daoud!

I'm a **Machine Learning Engineer** passionate about building AI-driven solutions and machine learning models that solve real-world problems. While pursuing my degree in **Computer Science and Information Technology**, I realized my true interest lay beyond traditional academiaâ€”I'm driven by hands-on learning, experimentation, and creating impactful projects from scratch.

## ðŸŒŸ My Journey in Tech

I began coding at age 12, fueled by a fascination with creating something from nothing using a few lines of code. Initially exploring **Python** and **web development**, my interests evolved toward **AI** and **machine learning**. I've built a diverse skill set through self-learning and real-world projects, focusing on machine learning, data science, and AI.
