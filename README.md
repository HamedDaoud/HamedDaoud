# Hi, I'm Hamed Daoud!

I'm a **Machine Learning Engineer** with a deep passion for building AI-driven solutions and machine learning models that solve real-world problems. While pursuing my degree in **Computer Science and Information Technology**, I realized that my true interests lay beyond traditional academiaâ€”I'm driven by hands-on learning, experimenting with code, and creating impactful projects from scratch.

## ðŸŒŸ My Journey in Tech

I started coding at the age of 12, fueled by a fascination with the power to create something from nothing with just a few lines of code. Over time, my focus evolved from hobby projects in **Python** and **web development** to a deep interest in **AI** and **machine learning**. Iâ€™ve built a diverse skill set through self-driven learning and real-world projects, particularly in the areas of machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence.

## ðŸ›  Core Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost, OpenAI Gym (Reinforcement Learning)
- **Data Science**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
- **Mathematics**: Linear algebra, calculus, statistics, probability
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Logistic regression, decision trees and tree ensembles (RandomForest and XGBoost), neural networks, k-means, reinforcement learning (Q-learning)
- **Data Visualization**: PowerBI, Tableau

## ðŸŒ± Working Knowledge

- **SQL**: Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL
- **Spreadsheets**: Excel, Google Sheets
- **Programming Languages**: C++, C#, HTML/CSS
- **Environment Management**: Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks, Conda for virtual environments
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Model Deployment (Learning)**: Flask, Docker, AWS

## ðŸ’¡ What Drives Me

- **Self-Learner**: I thrive on self-driven learning, continuously diving into new technologies and frameworks outside of formal education. Iâ€™m particularly interested in implementing machine learning models from scratch and understanding the math that drives them.
- **Problem-Solver**: I enjoy taking complex problemsâ€”whether technical or personalâ€”and breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces. AI and machine learning give me the tools to tackle these problems at scale.
- **Building from Scratch**: I take pride in building things from the ground up, avoiding reliance on shortcuts or prebuilt utilities. For every major project I undertake, I challenge myself to understand every layer of the tech stack.

## ðŸ“š Education

- **B.Sc. in Computer Science and Information Technology**  
  Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology (E-JUST)  
  Focus: AI and Data Science

While Iâ€™ve completed my formal studies, Iâ€™ve always prioritized **hands-on experience** and **self-learning** over traditional academia. My passion for understanding and applying machine learning concepts has driven my success, and Iâ€™m constantly building projects that stretch the limits of what I know.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Currently Working On

- Expanding my knowledge of **MLOps**, including **Docker**, **Flask**, and **AWS**, to deploy and scale machine learning models in production environments.
- Exploring **Deep Reinforcement Learning** and strengthening my skills in advanced AI algorithms.
